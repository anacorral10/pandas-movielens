# Case Study: Movie Data Analysis
This Jupyter notebook contains a case study I used to learn pandas, the primary data analysis library in Python.
This case study uses a dataset from the MovieLens website. I will describe the dataset further as we explore with it using **pandas**.

## Download the Dataset
Please note that you will need to download the dataset. The folder turned out to be too large to fit on this platform due to size constraints.

Here are the links to the data source and location:
* *Data Source:* MovieLens web site (filename: ml-25m.zip)
* *Location:* https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

Should be the first zip file on the page
Once the download completes, please make sure the data files are in the directory of the jupyter notebook folder.


## Intro to Pandas
**Pandas** is a Python library for data analysis. It offers a number of data exploration, cleaning and transformation operations that are critical in working with data in Python.

pandas build upon numpy and scipy providing easy-to-use data structures and data manipulation functions with integrated indexing.

The main data structures pandas provides are Series and DataFrames. After a brief introduction to these two data structures and data ingestion, the key features of pandas this notebook covers are:

* Generating descriptive statistics on data
* Data cleaning using built in pandas functions
* Frequent data operations for subsetting, filtering, insertion, deletion and aggregation of data
* Merging multiple datasets using dataframes
* Working with timestamps and time-series data
